<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Computer-Vision
Computer Vision Course - Fall 2022

----------------------------------------------------


My solutions to IUST's Computer Vision course homeworks and final project, Fall 2022.

Here's what it contains:
* HW1: Intro to OpenCV
* HW2: Camera Calibration
* HW3: Histogram equalization, CLAHE, Histogram matching
* HW4: Image in fourier domain
* HW5: Edge detection
* HW6: Line detection
* HW7: Simple CamScanner
* HW8: Text detection and extraction
* HW9: Image skeletonization
* HW10: LBP, Compactness, Eccentricity, etc
* HW11: Classification on cifar10, Transfer learning with ResNet50
* Final Project: Tile Crack Detection using U-Net


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Tile Crack Detection Project
 This project is for detecting tile cracks in images using digital image processing and deep learning. Given a tile image and its pattern, it will give us the crack by a segmentation task, and U-Net was used for this part.

### How to run

In the tile-crack-detection folder, change the directories according to yours and run "run_me.ipynb".

## Acknowledgments

The final project's segmentation task was done with the help of [Surface Crack Detection](https://github.com/arthurflor23/surface-crack-detection) repository.
